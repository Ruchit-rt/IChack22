-- Twitter API based game for IC HACK 2022 --

IC hack is one of Imperial College Computing's most reknowned events with sponsors, enthusiasts and educationists all in one place!

Using the **Twitter API** and **poisson disk sampling** we created a game where the user has to evade enemies that change dynamically with changing twitter trends. It was one of the most fun 24 hours we have spent here at college.
